## FAQ

### What sort of setup do I need for WordPress?

You'll need either a local or public WordPress site with the [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) plugin installed and activated.

I'm planning support for additional features like menus, CPT's, SEO, and more.

### What happened to your old repo? The one with Docker, Mantine, and all the other stuff?

I've decided to simplify things based on the Next.js 13 App Router. You can however still [view the old repo](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress/tree/1.0.0).
